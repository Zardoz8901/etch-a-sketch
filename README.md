# etch-a-sketch
Create an etch-a-sketch in HTML, JS and CSS  
  
<!-- Future Updates *  

* Add a block counter to show how many remaining blocks remain from the total  
* Add adjustment sliders and more tactile/pertinent user feedback  
* Inject animation and breath/breathing as opposed to static architecture  
  Think a roman column vs a tree, a SNES menu vs a paperback table of contents
